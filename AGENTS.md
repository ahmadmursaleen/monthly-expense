# Task protocol (read first)

Work is tracked in `tasks/*.md`, one file per task. Git is the only source of truth. Never edit the
`status`/`owner` fields by hand; use `python tasks.py`.

1. `python tasks.py next` - ready tasks, most-blocking first. Prefer the top one.
2. `python tasks.py claim <id>` - atomic. If it prints `LOST RACE`, go back to step 1.
   Do not start work before you see `CLAIMED`. If it says earlier unfinished work exists on
   `origin/wip/<id>` (its previous owner died or released it), merge that first and continue from it.
3. Implement only what the task's acceptance criteria say. Commit code often (the agent runner backs up
   your commits to `wip/<id>`) and run `git pull --rebase` every few commits, so conflicts with other
   agents show up early and small. Never `git push` to main yourself: `done` pushes your work once it
   passes the check, so main only ever holds finished tasks (it is published to the original repos).
4. `python tasks.py done <id>` when all criteria are met. It merges the latest main, runs the project
   check (`.taskcheck`) on the merged result, and only then marks the task done and pushes. If the
   check fails, fix it and run `done` again. Then go to step 1.
5. Stuck or abandoning? Commit your work, then `python tasks.py release <id> --note "<what is done, what blocks>"`.
   Your unfinished commits go to `wip/<id>` for the next owner, not to main.
6. Missing task discovered? `python tasks.py new <id> "<title>" --deps a,b`, commit, push.
7. If any command prints `REFUSED` or `LOST`, the task was taken over by someone else (your lease
   expired) or a human changed the plan (dropped it or put it on hold): stop working on it immediately.
8. If `next` or `claim` prints `FROZEN`, humans are changing the plan: finish a task you already own,
   but claim nothing new. Stop.
## Quality gate before completing implementation tasks

For implementation tasks, the parent Taskflow worker owns the task from claim through completion.

Before running `tasks.py done`, the parent worker must complete this quality workflow:

1. Finish the implementation for the claimed task.
2. Invoke the `test-writer` sub-agent to:
    - inspect the task acceptance criteria and changed behavior;
    - add or improve relevant tests;
    - run focused tests and broader validation where practical;
    - report any production bugs it finds.
3. Invoke the `code-reviewer` sub-agent to:
    - review the implementation against the current task acceptance criteria;
    - check applicable project architecture, integration, security, tests, and maintainability;
    - report only validated, evidence-based findings.
4. If the test-writer or code-reviewer reports valid issues, invoke the `fixer` sub-agent to resolve them.
5. Re-run relevant tests after fixes.
6. If material fixes were made, re-run `code-reviewer` when useful to confirm the issues are resolved.
7. Run `.taskcheck`.
8. Only when required behavior is implemented, important findings are resolved, and `.taskcheck` passes may the parent worker run `tasks.py done`.

### Quality sub-agent boundaries

`test-writer`, `code-reviewer`, and `fixer` are helper sub-agents within the current claimed task.

They are not Taskflow workers and must not:

- claim, release, hold, unhold, drop, or complete Taskflow tasks;
- run `tasks.py done`;
- push;
- change branches;
- merge or rebase;
- launch additional Taskflow workers;
- wait for human input.

If a quality sub-agent cannot proceed, it must return the reason to the parent worker.

The parent Taskflow worker remains responsible for:

- Taskflow task state;
- assumptions;
- holds;
- releases;
- deciding whether a finding is in scope;
- running final validation;
- completing the task.

#### Frontend implementation

For tasks that create or materially change a user-facing frontend or interface, use the available `frontend-design` plugin/skill when applicable.

Use it to establish and implement the visual direction of the interface before or during frontend implementation.

Do not invoke it for:

- backend-only tasks;
- infrastructure tasks;
- database-only tasks;
- documentation-only tasks;
- non-visual refactoring;
- tasks where the current design must remain unchanged.

The current task acceptance criteria, `SPEC.md`, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` remain authoritative. Frontend Design may improve presentation and implementation quality, but it must not invent product requirements or expand the task scope.

## Assumptions
Humans may be asleep: don't wait for answers and don't stop because something is unclear. Choose the most
reasonable option that fits the spec, then record it right away:
`python tasks.py assume <id> "<what you assumed, and why>"`. One line per decision a human might want
to revisit (a guessed requirement, a library choice, a behavior the spec doesn't define, a shortcut you
took). Humans review them with `python tasks.py assumptions`. Keep working as if the assumption were true.

## Merge conflicts
Other agents change main while you work, so `git pull --rebase` (or `done`) can stop with CONFLICT.
Your work is never lost. Take the first step that fits:

a. **Obvious fix** (imports, both sides added lines, formatting, a rename): resolve, `git add`,
   `git rebase --continue`. Being sure isn't enough: the resolution only counts if the check passes,
   which `done` verifies.
b. **Many conflicts** (the same ones again for each commit): `git rebase --abort`, then
   `git merge origin/main`: you resolve once for the whole task instead of once per commit.
c. **Not obvious** (you'd have to guess what the other change meant, or the check keeps failing after
   merging): `python tasks.py redo <id>`. It saves your attempt as `wip/<id>-attemptN`, resets your
   clone to the latest main, and you keep the task. Re-implement it on top of the new code, using the
   old attempt as a reference (`git diff HEAD...origin/wip/<id>-attemptN`): reuse its design and
   tests, but don't merge it.
d. **The tasks disagree on design** (e.g. both changed the API contract differently): that is a spec
   problem, not a git problem. Run `redo` (c), then `python tasks.py release <id> --note "conflicts with
   <other task>: <what>"`, and add a task to reconcile them if one is missing.

A clean merge can still break things (another task renamed what you call). That's why `done` runs
the check after merging.

## Too big or stuck
A task should take 30-90 min. The runner gives each agent 2 sessions per task, then asks for a review.
You can also decide this earlier, as soon as you see it:
- **Nearly done:** `python tasks.py extend <id> --note "<what is left>"` (one more session, once).
- **Too big:** write the remaining work as 2-6 subtasks into a file, then
  `python tasks.py split <id> --from <file> --note "<what is done so far>"`. File format:
  ```
  ## auth-login: Login endpoint
  deps: auth-model
  Goal: POST /login returns a JWT for valid credentials.
  - [ ] endpoint + tests
  - [ ] wrong password -> 401
  ## auth-model: User model and password hashing
  - [ ] ...
  ```
  Ids: a-z, 0-9, `-`. The optional `deps:` line may name other subtasks or existing tasks. Your
  committed work goes to `wip/<id>` for the subtasks. The original task then waits for them; whoever
  claims it afterwards only integrates and verifies its acceptance criteria. Subtasks can't be split
  again: put them on hold instead.
- **Stuck** (unclear requirement, missing dependency, a decision is needed, the check fails for reasons
  outside your task): `python tasks.py hold <id> "<what a human must decide or do>"`. Agents won't
  pick it up until a human runs `python tasks.py unhold <id>`.

## Several repos
If `repos.txt` exists, folders such as `backend/` and `frontend/` are other repos imported into this
one. Just work in the folders: a change touching several of them is one commit, and `tasks.py repos
sync` publishes each folder to its repo. Don't edit `repos.txt`, don't run `git subtree`, don't push
to those repos directly.

Humans change the plan with `drop`/`undrop` (a task is no longer wanted) and `freeze`/`unfreeze` (no new
claims while they replan). Agents don't use these.

Other commands: `list`, `status`, `check` (validates deps/cycles), `graph` (writes BOARD.md + board.html),
`heartbeat` (renews your leases; the agent runner does this for you), `redo` (see Merge conflicts),
`extend` / `split` / `hold` (see Too big or stuck).

## Project notes
Monthly expense tracker: `backend/` (Express + `node:sqlite`) and `frontend/` (React + Vite), one npm
workspace. Details: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Requirements: `SPEC.md`.

- **Install:** `npm install` at the repo root (Node 22.13+). After pulling a lockfile change, run it again.
- **Run:** `npm run dev -w backend` (API on :3001) and `npm run dev -w frontend` (UI on :5173, proxies `/api`).
- **Test:** `npm run check` (lint + type-check + all tests). `.taskcheck` runs `sh scripts/check.sh`,
  which does the same after `npm ci` if needed.

Conventions:
- TypeScript strict everywhere; no `any` unless unavoidable (then say why in a comment).
- Tests live next to the code (`foo.ts` + `foo.test.ts`). Every new behavior gets a test.
  Backend HTTP tests use supertest on `createApp(openDb(":memory:"))`; never touch the real DB file.
- Backend: only `src/db.ts` opens SQLite; SQL lives in repository modules, HTTP in routers. Validate
  request bodies in the router and answer `400 {"error": string, "fields"?: {...}}`.
- Frontend: only `src/api.ts` calls `fetch`. Components show loading, empty and error states.
- Money is stored as integer cents; dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` strings; months as `YYYY-MM`.
- Add dependencies with `npm install -w backend|frontend <pkg>` and commit `package-lock.json`.
  Keep TypeScript below 6.1 (typescript-eslint peer range).
- Commit sub-agent reports in `reviews/` together with the task's code.
